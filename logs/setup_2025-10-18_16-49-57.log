        Python recognizes 'pywal.backends' as an importable package[^1],
        but it is absent from setuptools' `packages` configuration.

        This leads to an ambiguous overall configuration. If you want to distribute this
        package, please make sure that 'pywal.backends' is explicitly added
        to the `packages` configuration field.

        Alternatively, you can also rely on setuptools' discovery methods
        (for example by using `find_namespace_packages(...)`/`find_namespace:`
        instead of `find_packages(...)`/`find:`).

        You can read more about "package discovery" on setuptools documentation page:

        - https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html

        If you don't want 'pywal.backends' to be distributed and are
        already explicitly excluding 'pywal.backends' via
        `find_namespace_packages(...)/find_namespace` or `find_packages(...)/find`,
        you can try to use `exclude_package_data`, or `include-package-data=False` in
        combination with a more fine grained `package-data` configuration.

        You can read more about "package data files" on setuptools documentation page:

        (for example by using `find_namespace_packages(...)`/`find_namespace:`
        instead of `find_packages(...)`/`find:`).

        You can read more about "package discovery" on setuptools documentation page:

        - https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html

        `find_namespace_packages(...)/find_namespace` or `find_packages(...)/find`,
        you can try to use `exclude_package_data`, or `include-package-data=False` in
        combination with a more fine grained `package-data` configuration.

installing woff2-font-awesome...

:: Starting from version 7.0.0, the Font Awesome upstream no longer includes '.ttf' webfonts
   and instead provides them in '.woff2' format, which is now the standard for webfont delivery.

   The 'ttf-font-awesome' package has therefore been replaced by the 'woff2-font-awesome' one.

   If your project(s) or configuration(s) still depend on '.ttf' files, please update
   them to use the '.woff2' format instead.

   See https://fontawesome.com/changelog for more details.
