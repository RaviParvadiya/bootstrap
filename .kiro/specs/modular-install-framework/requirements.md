# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a fully modular install.sh framework that automates the complete restoration of a Linux development environment. The framework will support both Arch Linux (complete installation from scratch) and Ubuntu (Hyprland environment installation), with consistent configuration management, NVIDIA GPU support, and a modular, extensible architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want a modular installation framework that can detect my distribution and run the appropriate installation scripts, so that I can restore my complete development environment on any supported system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the install script is executed THEN the system SHALL automatically detect whether it's running on Arch Linux or Ubuntu
2. WHEN Arch Linux is detected THEN the system SHALL offer complete installation from scratch to a fully working setup
3. WHEN Ubuntu is detected THEN the system SHALL offer Hyprland window manager environment installation with component selection
4. WHEN Ubuntu installation is selected THEN the system SHALL only handle user-space environment setup (Hyprland + configs), not full OS installation or base package setup
5. WHEN an unsupported distribution is detected THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with specific hardware requirements, I want the framework to support NVIDIA GPU configuration for my ASUS TUF Dash F15 laptop with MUX switch, so that my graphics setup works correctly after installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NVIDIA GPU is detected THEN the system SHALL offer to install appropriate NVIDIA drivers
2. WHEN NVIDIA installation is selected THEN the system SHALL configure MUX switch support for ASUS TUF Dash F15
3. WHEN NVIDIA drivers are installed THEN the system SHALL configure proper environment variables and kernel modules
4. WHEN NVIDIA setup is complete THEN the system SHALL rebuild initramfs and configure modprobe settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who values system control, I want to ensure no unwanted services start automatically, so that everything runs only when I launch it manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are installed THEN the system SHALL NOT enable them automatically
2. WHEN the installation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a list of available services that can be manually enabled
3. WHEN service management is requested THEN the system SHALL allow selective enabling/disabling of services
4. WHEN system startup occurs THEN only essential system services SHALL be running

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular and scalable framework structure, so that I can easily extend it with new tools, configurations, or distributions in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework is structured THEN it SHALL use separate modules for different functionality (packages, configs, services, etc.)
2. WHEN new distributions need support THEN the system SHALL allow adding new distribution modules without modifying existing code
3. WHEN new tools are added THEN the system SHALL support adding them through configuration files rather than code changes
4. WHEN the framework is extended THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who wants control over the installation process, I want an interactive component selection system, so that I can choose which parts of my environment to install during setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the installation starts THEN the system SHALL present a menu of available components (terminal, configs, tools, etc.)
2. WHEN components are selected THEN the system SHALL install only the chosen components and their dependencies
3. WHEN component selection is complete THEN the system SHALL show a summary of what will be installed
4. WHEN installation proceeds THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback for each component

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who wants to test safely, I want multiple testing modes including dry-run, VM support, and backup creation, so that I can validate the installation without breaking my current system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dry-run mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL show what would be executed without making any changes
2. WHEN backup mode is requested THEN the system SHALL create backups of existing configurations before making changes
3. WHEN VM mode is detected THEN the system SHALL skip hardware-specific configurations
4. WHEN testing mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of all operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with existing dotfiles, I want the framework to use my consistent configuration files from my dotfiles repository, so that my environment is restored exactly as configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dotfiles are processed THEN the system SHALL read the existing dotfiles structure and preserve the organization
2. WHEN configurations are applied THEN the system SHALL use symlinks or proper copying to maintain consistency with the dotfiles repository
3. WHEN configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL prompt for resolution or create backups
4. WHEN dotfiles are updated THEN the system SHALL support updating the installed configurations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user who needs comprehensive package management, I want the framework to handle packages from multiple sources (official repos, AUR, custom builds), so that all my required software is installed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package lists are processed THEN the system SHALL categorize packages by source (official, AUR, custom)
2. WHEN AUR helper is missing THEN the system SHALL install yay or paru automatically
3. WHEN packages are installed THEN the system SHALL handle dependencies and conflicts appropriately
4. WHEN installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and continue with remaining packages

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user who values maintainability, I want the framework to have clear documentation and inline comments, so that I can understand and modify the scripts as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scripts are created THEN they SHALL include comprehensive inline comments explaining each section
2. WHEN the framework is delivered THEN it SHALL include documentation explaining the folder structure and file interactions
3. WHEN functions are defined THEN they SHALL have clear parameter documentation and usage examples
4. WHEN the framework is used THEN it SHALL provide helpful error messages and usage instructions
5. WHEN the framework is delivered THEN it SHALL include a step-by-step installation guide (README or INSTALL.md) explaining how to run the script on Arch vs Ubuntu
6. WHEN user documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include examples of component selection and testing modes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user who wants production-ready code, I want the framework to include proper error handling, logging, and validation, so that it works reliably in real-world scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately and continue with remaining operations where possible
2. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL stop execution and provide recovery instructions
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL log success status and any important information
4. WHEN the framework runs THEN it SHALL validate prerequisites and system requirements before proceeding
